# CognitoUi - AWS Cognito User Authentication Angular App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.2. \
It is a showcase of using [aws cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as an authentication service with a [nodejs backend](https://github.com/micromin/cognito-auth). 
As you may know, Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily.

I hope, this project can be used as a starter for your next idea.
